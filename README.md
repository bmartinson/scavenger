# Scavenger Games

This project aims to provide an easy to use framework that allows users to create real world scavenger hunts that are augmented by digital content delivered through check-ins at physical waypoints using QR codes. The project was developed using Angular CLI 11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Services

The API services that are in use by the application always use the hosted live API deployed at www.scavenger.games/api/. In order to properly build and deploy these services, you must have a `db-definitions.php` file in `/src/api/common/` defining the database connection variables and keys required for connecting to the MySQL database that backs the project. This information is not tracked by this repository. If you need assistance setting up your own database or would like to request access to work on the production database for www.scavenger.games, please contact [Brian](mailto:brian@brianmartinson.com).
