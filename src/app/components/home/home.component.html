  Right now, we're mostly focusing our efforts on end-user game play and API services to support the management tools
  that will live here alongside other informational content. Things might look a little sparse from this on the site in
  the meantime. Feel free to check in on our progress on <a
     href="https://www.github.com/bmartinson/scavenger">GitHub</a> in the meantime or <a
     href="help@scavenger.games">contact us</a> to help get an early form of our game hosted for you and help us
  build the best experience possible!
